= Monitoring Apps

== Overview

In this lab we will be looking at how to view logs and metrics for apps.

== Set up the working dir

. Change the working directory to be _ops-workshop/labs/my_work/dotnet-core-sample_

== viewing the logs

. view recent logs for your app

----
$ cf logs --recent <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. tail the logs  for your app

----
$ cf logs  <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. these can also be viewed in the "Logs" tab in appsman

. notice the different type of logs that are emitted. you should see things like _RTR_ and _APP_ . as list of all types can be found https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#format[here]

== SSH into your app

. sometimes it can be useful to ssh in to the container if something strange it happening. this is not recomended to be enabled in prod. however in  non-prod it can be useful

. ssh into your app

----
$ cf ssh -k <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. you can poke around at the filesystem in the container now.

== using PCF Metrics

. login to apps man and go to your app.

. click on the pcf metrics link above your app instances.

. you will see some default monitors built for your application. new monitors can be added based custom metrics from the apps. 

. you can also search the log history by clicking on the logs tab at the bottom of the page

. create an event monitor for the app

. create a new event monitor

. create an ssh monitor

. we will skip the webhook for now but if you have slack for example you could send alerts there.

. now ssh into your app a few times

----
$ cf ssh -k  <your-initials>-sample-app
----

. check the triggered events log, it may take a minute to register the event trigger.
