= Labs

Welcome to the lab! Here you will find a collection of exercises and accompanying source-code.

== Overview

This workshop contains a number of labs meant to be worked through in numerical order - as each exercise builds upon the last. The only exception to this sequence is the *00* folder. This folder references sample applications in *samples*.  These applications can be pushed to Cloud Foundry at any time.

Your workspace is the *my_work* folder.


== PCF Environment Access

This workshop assumes participants will be interacting with PCF One.  Depending on the client and environment, ask the instuctor for an alternate CF API endpoint and/or url for the Apps Manager UI. If there is an alternate CF api replace anywhere that has `api.run.pcfone.io` with the new endpoint.

=== Account set up

----
$ cf api https://api.run.pcfone.io
$ cf login

== Apps Manager UI

. An alternative to installing the CF CLI is via your PCF Apps Manager interface.

. Navigate in a web browser to (depending on environment):
+
----
https://apps.run.pcfone.io
